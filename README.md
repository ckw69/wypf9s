Why did i make this ?
- Because redblue wyvern has a drainer so i removed it and replaced everything with mine so he can't do anything if he wants to.

Why can i trust your wyborn doesn't have drainer ?
- I don't really know anything about lua but can at least somewhat read and understand it, which means i won't be able to add a drainer and the code is all open sourced and im not gonna obfuscate it so if you don't trust check the code yourself.

Why name it wyborn ?
- Wyvern + reborn = wyborn
